\hfill \textbf{March 12, 2015}

Write a class \texttt{Cat.java} with two instance variables position and name and a method \texttt{move(int dist}). Method \texttt{move(int dist)} changes position of the object on which it is invoked and at every call will print a message of the following form. At this point, you are not required to use constructors, accessors or modifiers.

\begin{verbatim}
object.name moved dist forward.
Current posiion of object.name: object.position
\end{verbatim}

Use your class \texttt{Cat.java} in another class \texttt{Cat1Dtest.java} following the steps below.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
\item Create a cat object and name it kitty.
\item Initialize position of kitty to 0 of the x-axis.
\item Use the move method as you like to change position of kitty.
\item Modify your class \texttt{Cat.java} so that you can use it in another class \texttt{Cat2Dtest.java} where you can control position of kitty in Cartesian Coordinates.
\end{enumerate}
