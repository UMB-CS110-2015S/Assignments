\subsection*{Week 3}
\hfill \textbf{February 24, 2015}

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep=0pt
\item Write a program that rolls two 6-side standard dice to get two numbers $A$ and $B$ until $A = B$ and both greater than $4$. If they are, it would roll the two dice $(A + B)$ times and prints the total sum of numbers that would appear. Students should show numbers that appear as well.
\item Write a program that takes number $A$ as command-line argument and generates a random number between $A$ and $10*A$.
\item Write a program that takes polar coordinates as command-line argument and converts them to Cartesian coordinates.
\end{enumerate}
