\subsection*{Week 2}
\hfill \textbf{February 17, 2015}

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep=0pt
\item Write a program that takes two numbers as command line arguments and shows their sum.
\item Write a program that calculates distant x using the formula $x = \frac{1}{2}at^2 + v_0t+x_0$. The program should set variables a, $v_0$ and $x_0$ as predefined and takes time t as a command line argument and give the distance $x$.
\item Write a program that asks the user for a number $N$ during program and gives him the possibility to choose between computing the sum or product of numbers $1$ to $N$.
\end{enumerate}
