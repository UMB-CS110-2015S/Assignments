\subsection*{Week 8}
\hfill \textbf{April 9, 2015}

A highschool principal has decided to make a virtual gradebook with which he can access grade of some student in some course, GPA of some student and average GPA of all students.
Obviously, he should be able to add or modify a student, a grade or a course.
He has promised however that he will never attempt to remove any information previously entered.
Assuming number of students and courses are no more than 100 and 50 respectively, write a program \texttt{VirtualSchool.java} with as many Classes as you think are required that satisfies expectations of the principal.
