\subsection*{Week 11}
\hfill \textbf{April 30, 2015}

Write a program \texttt{GunFight.java} in which you can use two different guns of class \texttt{Gun.java}; one double-barreled shotgun of class \texttt{Shotgun.java} and one semi-automatic pistol of class \texttt{Pistol.java}.
Both guns fire as long as they have enough ammunition.
Once they run out of ammo, they need to reload.
Shotgun takes between 2 to 3 seconds to reload while the pistol takes between 5 to 7 seconds as you should replace the entire ammo belt which has 10 bullets.
The pistol can fire at a rate of 4 bullets per second but at the best case, chance of hitting the target is only 50\%.
Shotgun on the other hand takes 1 second to fire (you can fire both barrels at the same time) but can hit the target by up to 80\%.
Assumming both guns are preloaded, your program \texttt{GunFight.java} should find how many successful hits can be achieved with each gun in 1 minute.
