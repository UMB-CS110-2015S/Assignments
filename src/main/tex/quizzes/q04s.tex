\section*{Question 1}

Write a program \texttt{AutoShow.java} that can control different automobiles. All cars have some seating capacity. As expected from any vehicle, they move provided that at least one person is in the car, the engine is on and the fuel tank is not empty. For safety reasons, no one can enter or exit the car when the engine is on.

Based on specified conditions, develop a class \texttt{Car.java} and instantiate two cars inside \texttt{AutoShow.java} program where \texttt{car1} has a tank size of 100 miles and can seat up to four people while \texttt{car2} has a tank size of 150 miles and can only seat up to 2 people. Move 200 miles with each car. Make sure your program will print an output for all methods regardless of the order in which they are invoked.

\item Class \texttt{AutoShow.java}

\begin{lstlisting}

		// we cannot just start engine since no one is in the car yet
		car1.switchEngine();
		// if at least one goes in the car
		car1.board(1);

		car1.move(10);
		// we will then be able to start engine

		// we can then move

		// but if we move for too long, we'll run out of fuel
		car1.move(100);

		car1.move(10);
		// so we have to refuel
		car1.refuel();
		// and then we can move again
		car1.move(100);
		// now we moved 200 miles, but we cannot just get out
		car1.getOff(1);
		// since we should turn the engine off first
		car1.switchEngine();
		// and we can get off now
		car1.getOff(1);
