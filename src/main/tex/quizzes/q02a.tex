\section*{Question 1}

Write a program \texttt{PrimeRelative.java} that asks for \texttt{N} from the user and prints out an \texttt{N}-by-\texttt{N} table such that there is an \texttt{*} in row \texttt{i} and column \texttt{j}, if the greatest common divisor of \texttt{i} and \texttt{j} is 1, and a space in that position if otherwise.

\section*{Question 2}

Write a program \texttt{MatrixDeterminant.java} that asks for elements of a three-by-three matrix and prints its determinant.
