\section*{Question 1}

According to National Weather Serivce, the \textit{Wind Chill} can be computed as given in Equation \ref{eq1}, where $t$ is the temperature in Fahrenheit and $v$ is the wind speed in miles per hour.

\begin{equation}
w = 35.74 + 0.6215 t + (0.4275t-35.75)v^{0.16}
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}

Write a program \texttt{WindChill.java} that takes temperature in Celsius and using Equation \ref{eq1} gives the wind chill in Celsius.
Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion formula is given in Equation \ref{eq2}.

\begin{equation}
t_F = 1.8 \times t_C + 32
\label{eq2}
\end{equation}

\section*{Question 2}
