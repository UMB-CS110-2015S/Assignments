This repository contains course material developed for *CS110: Introduction to Computing* course at [University of Massachusetts Boston] as taught by [Pejman Ghorbanzade] in Spring 2015. The material include 600+ lecture slides, 150+ pages of problem sets and their solutions as well as 1850 source lines of Java code which are released in hope that they will be useful for anyone interested in learning fundamentals of computer programming using Java.

## Syllabus
The course syllabus, as thought in Spring 2015, can be found in [`Syllabus`] directory.

## Development
Instructions for building source codes and documents are described in details in Wiki pages under _[Dependencies]_ section.

## Contribution
To keep it as taught in Spring 2015, content of this repository is **not** subject to change. Bug reports however are immensely appreciated. If you are willing to further contribute to developing course material for an introductory course to programming in Java, Please checkout [java-101] repository.
