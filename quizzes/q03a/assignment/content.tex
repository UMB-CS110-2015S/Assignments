\section*{Question 1}
You are asked to develop a simple ticket printing machine for box-office of a small cinema with a total of 50 seats, 10 seats in each row.
Ticketing procedure is based on a few simple policies as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-2mm,label={}]
  \item Rows closer to screen are always prioritized.
  \item Seats in a row are filled from the leftmost to the rightmost.
  \item All seats assigned to a group of people must be in the same row.
\end{enumerate}

Develop a class \texttt{Theater.java} with class members that you think are required for this objective and use your class in a program \texttt{TicketSale.java} that prompts ticket seller for number of tickets to print, showing the number of total available seats at the same time.
If sufficient number of seats are available in a single row, your program should print the list of seats assigned to the group.
Otherwise, it should show a warning indicating tickets are not available for the group.
Program terminates when all tickets are sold and no more seats are available.
