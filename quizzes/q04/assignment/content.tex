\section*{Question 1}

Write a program \texttt{AutoShow.java} that can control different automobiles. All cars have some seating capacity. As expected from any vehicle, they move provided that at least one person is in the car, the engine is on and the fuel tank is not empty. For safety reasons, no one can enter or exit the car when the engine is on.

Based on specified conditions, develop a class \texttt{Car.java} and instantiate two cars inside \texttt{AutoShow.java} program where \texttt{car1} has a tank size of 100 miles and can seat up to four people while \texttt{car2} has a tank size of 150 miles and can only seat up to 2 people. Move 200 miles with each car. Make sure your program will print an output for all methods regardless of the order in which they are invoked.
